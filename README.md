# SimpleViewer
A simple jpeg image viewer for linux making use of XLib only (no Qt, GTK+ etc.)  
This is just a trial project for me to do some simple (low-level) programming on Linux.  
I made use of CodeBlocks and have provided the project file.   
It's a work in progress and many things could be improved and/or adjusted to your own taste.  
Feel free to use it as an example to program with the XLib library.
